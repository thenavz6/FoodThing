Calculating cheapest price is very difficult because if we select the cheapest thing, we are likely to have selected products we a low hit-rating!!! (Hence non-ideal)
So these should be the sorting order:
    Default: Pick product for each ingredient that has the highest hitscore
    Cheapest: Pick the cheapest of the prodcuts that from the products from 10% offset from highest hitscore

Make all the button post requests in the header into a common function so they have to only be changed/written in one place rather than most of the routes.
